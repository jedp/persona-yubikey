      p This is an experimental identity provider that lets people log into 
        | Mozilla Persona using YubiKey.  The user's identity is the ID component
        | extracted from the YubiKey.  Verification is done with the Yubico 
        | servers.

      p To give it a try, visit a site that supports Persona (such as 
        a(href='http://123done.org') 123done.org
        | ) and sign in as yubikey_id@gno.mn.

      p Your yubikey ID is the first 12 characters that the yubikey outputs
        | whenever you generate a one-time password.
